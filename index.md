<h1>HTML, CSS and GIT Review<h1>
  
<p> Welcome back to the yearlong Y2s! It's going to be awesome (I promise). <br> This lab has been created to refresh your memory and make sure you're still good in HTML, CSS and Git :P <br>
Let's start!</p> 

<p><b>First things first, <u>fork</u> this repo(sitory) and <u>clone</u> it to your desktop</b></p>

<h2> HTML Section </h2>
<li>
<ol>Create a file "hello.html".<br>
Open the 'hello.html' file using a browser (Like Chrome/Firefox), the page should be empty.</ol>
<ol>Make your page stand out!<br>
To do that:<li>
<ul>Open hello.html using sublime text.</ul>
<ul>Change it to be about a topic that you’re interested in, your page should have the following (doesn’t have to be in order):
	<li>
	<ul>Add/change the title of your page</ul>
	<ul>A body tag</ul>
	<ul>A p paragraph inside the body</ul>
	<ul>An h1 tag inside the body</ul>
	<ul>An h2 tag inside the body</ul>
	</li></ul></li></ol>
<ol>Add an image.<br>
In the same hello.html file, add an image related to the topic you wrote about. Set the width to 400px.</ol>
<ol>Add a link.<br>
Add a link to the Wikipedia page about the animal or the topic you're interested in.</ol>
</li>
<br>
<h2>CSS Section</h2>
<li>
<ol>Use the Tag selector to change the background of your HTML page to your favorite color.</ol>
<ol>Use an ID selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br>
A property could be: font-size, border, color, etc...</ol>

<ol>Use a class selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.</ol>
</li>
<br>

<h2>Git Section</h2> 
Commit and push your changes.
<br>To do that, remember you should:<br>
<li>
<ul>git add .</ul>
<ul>git commit -m "added hello.html. I am a pro!"</ul>
<ul>git push</ul>
</li>
<br>

<h2>Bonus Section</h2>
<p>If you have finished and still have time, first of all <b>GOOD JOB!</b> - Secondly,you can now customize your page as much as you want. If you remember our <b>CSS Tips and Tricks</b> from the summer you could do a lot of cool stuff (psstt... I love animations!)
